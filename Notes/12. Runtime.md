# Falco

Install
```
kubectl create ns falco 
helm repo add falcosecurity https://falcosecurity.github.io/charts 
helm repo update 
helm install -n falco falco falcosecurity/falco
```

Doesn't work, probably because of kernel issue? 
Had to add a value:
```
driver:
  enabled: true
  kind: modern-bpf
tty: true
```

Falco detects another container started
```
k run --rm -it --image=alpine -- sh
```

## Automated Response

Falco pushes sidekick to notify argo to do something.
