Static testing
Going to be using slscan.io
Find issues and vulnerabilities. White box. 

To run:
```docker run --rm -e "WORKSPACE=${PWD}" -v "$PWD:/app" shiftleft/sast-scan scan```

## Add to pipeline
```
---- build_agent
    - name: slscan
      image: shiftleft/sast-scan
      imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
      command: 
        - cat
      tty: true
---- Jenkinsfile
    stage('SAST') {
      steps {
        container('slscan') {
          sh 'scan --type java,depscan --build'
        }
      }
      post {
        success {	
          archiveArtifacts allowEmptyArchive: true, artifacts: 'reports/*', fingerprint: true, onlyIfSuccessful: true
        }
      }
    }
```

Pipeline failed because of vulnerabilities.
Then why didn't SCA fail, have to configure it in pom.xml
```
<configuration>
<failBuildOnCVSS>8</failBuildOnCVSS>
</configuration>
```

## Fix dependency issue 
Update the framework version in pom.xml
That fixes dependency issue, but the license check fails then. 

# Fix license issue 
Reads doc/dependency_decisions to find out which licenses are ok
