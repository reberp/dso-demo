# CIS Benchmarks
Going to use devsec kubernetes baseline. 
```
git clone https://github.com/dev-sec/cis-kubernetes-benchmark
inspec exec cis-kubernetes-benchmark
```
All skipped with k3d because it doesn't find the proxy or kubelet processes.

kube-hunter didn't find anything. 
```
docker run -it --rm --network host aquasec/kube-hunter
```

Run as job from aquasecurity/kube-hunter.git
```
k apply -f job.yaml
k logs -f kube-...
```
Found a few issues

# Kubesec
```
docker run -i kubesec/kubesec scan /dev/stdin < deploy/dso-demo-deploy.yaml
```
Points out some best practices. 

Add to pipeline
```
    stage('Scan k8s Deploy Code') {
      steps {
        container('docker-tools') {
          sh 'kubesec scan deploy/dso-demo-deploy.yaml'
        }
      }
    }
```
Fails. Need to fix issues:
* Resource contraints
```
        resources: 
          requests:
            cpu: "50m"
            memory: "100Mi"
          limits: 
            cpu: "50m"
            memory: "100Mi"
