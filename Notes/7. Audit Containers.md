# Linting with Dockle

Pipeline is already pushing to dockerhub, where dockle will pull it. 
Looks at dockerfile as well as generated image. Gives best practice advice.

# Scanning with Trivy

Detect vulnerabilities with configuration, files, software, etc. in images.
Can mount files and scan those as well as base image.

# Best practices

### Multi stage images: 
To reduce size and increase security. 
Second stage uses a different base, and then just takes the artifact from the build stage. 

```
# Build stage
FROM maven:amazoncorretto as BUILD
WORKDIR /app
COPY .  .
RUN mvn package -DskipTests 
# Run stage
FROM amazoncorretto as RUN
WORKDIR /run
COPY --from=BUILD /app/target/demo-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar demo.jar
EXPOSE 8080
CMD java  -jar /run/demo.jar
```
### Run as non root
Switch to a new user before launching application
Looks like corretto is already pretty locked down with no things on it, but 

### Health checks
